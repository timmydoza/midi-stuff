# midi

Uses the [web MIDI api](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/) (supported by Chrome) to connect to a MIDI keyboard and do crazy things, like play an upside-down piano.

Clone the repo, then:

`npm i`

Run `npm dev` to watch for changes, or `npm run build` to build static assets to `/build` folder.

If you use the same device for input and output (typical), then [local control](https://google.com/search?q=midi+local+control) should be turned off.
